# BrownianMotionCalculus

These are a list of simulations on Brownian motion. 

1. Random_Walk.py : Simulation of a Random Walk. In the small step limit, the random walk -> Brownian motion.
2. Brownian.py: Simulation of Brownian motion.
3. ItoDiscrete.py: Simulation of an Ito integral.
4. GBM.py: Simulation of pricing an european call option. There are two similar realizations of the Geometric Brownian Motion.
5. Call_option_MonteCarlo.ipynb: A jupyter notebook including for simulation of a european call options.
6. option_pricing_1step.py: Simulation of pricing european call option using the solution of the Geometric Brownian Motion directly.
